Description: EM algorithm for fitting Bayesian varying coefficient models with the nonparametric varying coefficient spike-and-slab lasso of Bai et al. (2020) <arXiv:1907.06477>. Also fits penalized frequentist varying coefficient models with the group lasso, group smoothly clipped absolute deviation, and group minimax concave penalty.
